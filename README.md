Other stuff I have tried:
* UnixPipe --> A unix shell focuses on programs concurrency
* AMTED --> A simple asymmetric multi-threaded event driven file server (AMTED)
* LFHT --> A lock-free hashtable implementation
* RDTSC --> RDTSC instruction test
* Zipf --> A zipf distribution generator
* ConcurrentHT --> A concurrent hashtable implementation
